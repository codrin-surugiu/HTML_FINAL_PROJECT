                The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job
                in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution
                perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of
                their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into
                account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split
                the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that
                means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one
                survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los
                Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and
                devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the
                traitor... The story on itself is of course not very original,
                since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has
                plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This
                is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the
                better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes
                and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special
                effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something
                which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that
                I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved
                7.5/10.

                Brian De Palma brings Mission: Impossible to the big screen in
                an explosive and action-packed adventure. Branded a trader when
                his team is killed during an intelligence operation, IMF agent
                Ethan Hunt goes rogue in order to clear his name. The plot's
                rather good, and does a fair job at building suspense and
                intrigue. Starring Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, and
                Ving Rhames, the casting's pretty solid. And, the action
                sequences are shot especially well, adding a lot of energy and
                intensity to the film. Danny Elfman's score is also excellently
                done. Incredibly entertaining, Mission: Impossible is a fun and
                thrilling action film.

                This film is filled with such memorable lines e.g.Travis Bickle
                'You talking to me? Well I'm the only one here.' and the many
                powerful scenes that stay in your head after it's finished. The
                hypnotic cinematography is a standout, as if your seeing the
                harsh & gritty New York streets and twisted people through the
                eyes of Travis when he is driving his cab. A great screenplay, a
                stunning score by Bernard Herrmann and a superb atmosphere
                created. This is a brutally compelling and bleak look at a
                decaying and corrupt society of the 70's. An unsettling gem of a
                film.
