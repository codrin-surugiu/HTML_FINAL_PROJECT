              So starts this action masterpiece from director Tony Scott. Hot
              shot pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) gets a chance to attend Fighter
              Weapons School or Top Gun in Miramar when his lead Cougar loses it
              in the air. He's met by cold as ice Iceman (Val Kilmer) as his
              calculating competition. He always has his navigator Goose
              (Anthony Edwards) by his side. He constantly tries to prove
              himself running on instinct against his father's perceived failed
              mission. Top Gun commanding officer is Viper (Tom Skerritt) and
              Jester (Michael Ironside) is an instructor. Charlie (Kelly
              McGillis) is a civilian instructor. The action is great. Tony
              Scott shoots the action like a music video and it looks amazing.
              He gets great access to military hardware and locations. This is
              not the older generation military movie. Movie star Tom Cruise is
              perfectly suited as Maverick. The only minor hiccup is the limited
              chemistry between McGillis and Cruise. It's not bad and it doesn't
              detract from anything. This movie just has all the fun 80s stuff.
              It's funny. It's fun. It's a great popcorn movie.
