              The Italian Job is well remembered for two things, the first of
              which is the Mini's. This is the film that made Mini's cool, so as
              you might expect, there is a fair amount of stunt work involving
              the Mini, a lot of which is truly spectacular - these little cars
              can be seen driving up stairs, onto and across roofs, through
              shopping centres, flying over various chasms etc and it's all very
              exciting. The second thing that it is remembered for is, of
              course, the line - "you were only supposed to blow the bloody
              doors off!", which is one of the most quoted of all time. The
              film's impact on popular culture has been immense, and that line's
              impact in particular is legendary; people that don't know the film
              know that line, and I dare say that a lot of them quote it even.
              It's up there with 'I'll be back' or 'that' line from Dirty Harry.
              The film also highlights a lot of British culture, most notably
              the reaction to something going right. English patriotism is a
              little different to the American version - while in America, the
              whole country may be united under the stars and stripes, very
              apple pie-like; England is much more content to chant a little
              inside of a prison.
