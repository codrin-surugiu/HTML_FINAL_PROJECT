              Brian De Palma brings Mission: Impossible to the big screen in an
              explosive and action-packed adventure. Branded a trader when his
              team is killed during an intelligence operation, IMF agent Ethan
              Hunt goes rogue in order to clear his name. The plot's rather
              good, and does a fair job at building suspense and intrigue.
              Starring Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, and Ving
              Rhames, the casting's pretty solid. And, the action sequences are
              shot especially well, adding a lot of energy and intensity to the
              film. Danny Elfman's score is also excellently done. Incredibly
              entertaining, Mission: Impossible is a fun and thrilling action
              film.
