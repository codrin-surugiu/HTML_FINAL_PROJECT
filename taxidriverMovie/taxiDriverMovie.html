            Not only one of Scorsese's best films, but one of the best of the
            70s. It is very hard hitting, dark and still has the resonance and
            power to shock. The cinematography is measured and chilly, yet
            very atmospheric, while Bernard Hermann's swansong score is
            superb, yet more proof at how amazing a composer he was. The story
            is unsettling but wonderfully told, and the script is brilliantly
            written. Scorcese also directs impeccably, while the acting is
            just excellent. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances,
            the whole film is worth watching just for his performance, that's
            how good it is, but that's not to dismiss Jodie Foster, Harvey
            Keitel and Cybill Sheppard in the supporting cast for they are
            just as good while Scorsese's own cameo is genuinely frightening.
            There you have it, another one of Scorsese's best with a brilliant
            atmosphere and mesmerising central performance. 10/10 Bethany Cox
